; This is a script (script-fu) for GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)

; to convert all opened files into black and white mode,

; and save them as TIFF CCITT (Group 4) format.

; Copy this file to "/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts"

; (or "/usr/local/share/gimp/scripts" etc).

; Open a PDF file as separate images in GIMP, and select the pull-down menu

; "Script-fu" - "Save all files as TIFF CCITT".
